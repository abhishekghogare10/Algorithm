        <h2>Breadth Path Finding Algorithm</h2>
        <br />
          <p>In this article, we will discuss the DFS algorithm in the data structure.
             It is a recursive algorithm to search all the vertices of a tree data structure or a graph.
              The depth-first search (DFS) algorithm starts with the initial node of graph G and goes deeper until we find the goal node or the node with no children.</p>
              <p>Because of the recursive nature, stack data structure can be used to implement the DFS algorithm.
                 The process of implementing the DFS is similar to the BFS algorithm.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>How does Breadth Path Finding Algorithm Work?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>Now, let's see the working of Breadth Path Finding Algorithm.</p>
        <p>Let's see how the Depth First Search algorithm works with an example. We use an undirected graph with 5 vertices.</p><p>Here, 26 is smaller than 36. So, swapping is required. After swapping new array will look like -</p>

        <p>Next, we visit the element at the top of stack i.e. 1 and go to its adjacent nodes. Since 0 has already been visited, we visit 2 instead.</p>          <h3 class="h3">First Pass</h3>

        <p>After we visit the last element 3, it doesn't have any unvisited adjacent nodes, so we have completed the Depth First Traversal of the graph.</p>
