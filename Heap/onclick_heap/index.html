        <h2>Heap Sort Algorithm</h2>
        <br />
        <p>n this article, we will discuss the Heapsort Algorithm. Heap sort processes the elements by creating the min-heap or max-heap using the elements of the given array. Min-heap or max-heap represents the ordering of array in which the root element represents the minimum or maximum element of the array.

          Heap sort basically recursively performs two main operations -
          
          Build a heap H, using the elements of array.
          Repeatedly delete the root element of the heap formed in 1st phase.
          Before knowing more about the heap sort, let's first see a brief description of Heap.</p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="h2">Working of Heap sort Algorithm</h2>
        <br />
        <p>Now, let's see the working of the Heapsort Algorithm.

          In heap sort, basically, there are two phases involved in the sorting of elements. By using the heap sort algorithm, they are as follows -
          
          The first step includes the creation of a heap by adjusting the elements of the array.
          After the creation of heap, now remove the root element of the heap repeatedly by shifting it to the end of the array, and then store the heap structure with the remaining elements.
          Now let's see the working of heap sort in detail by using an example. To understand it more clearly, let's take an unsorted array and try to sort it using heap sort. It will make the explanation clearer and easier.</p>

          <p>First, we have to construct a heap from the given array and convert it into max heap.
