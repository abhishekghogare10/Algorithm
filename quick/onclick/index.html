        <h2>Quick Sort Algorithm</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. 

Always pick the first element as a pivot.
Always pick the last element as a pivot (implemented below)
Pick a random element as a pivot.
Pick median as the pivot.
The key process in quickSort is a partition(). The target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of an array as the pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.
        </p>

        <h2>How does Quick Sort Work?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>To understand the working of quick sort, let's take an unsorted array. It will make the concept more clear and understandable.</p>
        <p>Let the elements of array are -</p>
        <p>Let the elements of array are -</p>

        <p>In the given array, we consider the leftmost element as pivot. So, in this case, a[left] = 24, a[right] = 27 and a[pivot] = 24.</p>
        <p>Since, pivot is at left, so algorithm starts from right and move towards left.</p>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/quick-sort3.png" alt="Quick Sort Algorithm">
        <p>Now, a[pivot] < a[right], so algorithm moves forward one position towards left, i.e. -</p>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/quick-sort4.png" alt="Quick Sort Algorithm">
        <p>Now, a[left] = 24, a[right] = 19, and a[pivot] = 24.</p>
        <p>Because, a[pivot] &gt; a[right], so, algorithm will swap a[pivot] with a[right], and pivot moves to right, as -</p>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/quick-sort5.png" alt="Quick Sort Algorithm">
        <p>Now, a[left] = 19, a[right] = 24, and a[pivot] = 24. Since, pivot is at right, so algorithm starts from left and moves to right.</p>
        <p>As a[pivot] > a[left], so algorithm moves one position to right as -</p>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/quick-sort6.png" alt="Quick Sort Algorithm">
        <p>Now, a[left] = 9, a[right] = 24, and a[pivot] = 24. As a[pivot] &gt; a[left], so algorithm moves one position to right as -</p>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/quick-sort7.png" alt="Quick Sort Algorithm">
        <p>Now, a[left] = 29, a[right] = 24, and a[pivot] = 24. As a[pivot] &lt; a[left], so, swap a[pivot] and a[left], now pivot is at left, i.e. -</p>

        <p>Now, a[pivot] = 24, a[left] = 14, and a[right] = 24. Pivot is at right, so the algorithm starts from left and move to right.</p>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/quick-sort11.png" alt="Quick Sort Algorithm">
        <p>Now, a[pivot] = 24, a[left] = 24, and a[right] = 24. So, pivot, left and right are pointing the same element. It represents the termination of procedure.

          Element 24, which is the pivot element is placed at its exact position.
          
          Elements that are right side of element 24 are greater than it, and the elements that are left side of element 24 are smaller than it.</p>

          <p>Now, in a similar manner, quick sort algorithm is separately applied to the left and right sub-arrays. After sorting gets done, the array will be -</p>
