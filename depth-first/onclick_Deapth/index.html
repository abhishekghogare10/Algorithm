        <h1>Depth First Search (DFS)</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="editor-contents__short-description">In this tutorial, you will learn about depth first search algorithm with example. Also, you will learn to implement DFS in C, Java, Python, and C++.</p>
        <p id="introduction">Depth first Search or Depth first traversal is a recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure. Traversal means visiting all the nodes of a graph.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="algo">Depth First Search Algorithm</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A standard DFS implementation puts each vertex of the graph into one of two categories:</p>
        <ol><li>Visited</li>
          <li>Not Visited</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>The purpose of the algorithm is to mark each vertex as visited while avoiding cycles.</p>
        <p>The DFS algorithm works as follows:</p>
        <br>
        <li>Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.</li>
        <li>Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.</li>
        <li>Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of the stack.</li>
        <li>Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.</li>
        <br>

        <p>Next, we visit the element at the top of stack i.e. 1 and go to its adjacent nodes. Since 0 has already been visited, we visit 2 instead.</p>

        <p>Vertex 2 has an unvisited adjacent vertex in 4, so we add that to the top of the stack and visit it.</p>

        <p>After we visit the last element 3, it doesn't have any unvisited adjacent nodes, so we have completed the Depth First Traversal of the graph.</p>
