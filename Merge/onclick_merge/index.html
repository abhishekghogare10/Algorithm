        <h2>Merge Sort Algorithm</h2>
        <br />
        <p>In this article, we will discuss the merge sort Algorithm. Merge sort is the sorting technique that follows the divide and conquer approach. This article will be very helpful and interesting to students as they might face merge sort as a question in their examinations. In coding or technical interviews for software engineers, sorting algorithms are widely asked. So, it is important to discuss the topic.</p>
        <p>Merge sort is similar to the quick sort algorithm as it uses the divide and conquer approach to sort the elements. It is one of the most popular and efficient sorting algorithm. It divides the given list into two equal halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. We have to define the <strong>merge()</strong> function to perform the merging.</p>
        <p>The sub-lists are divided again and again into halves until the list cannot be divided further. Then we combine the pair of one element lists into two-element lists, sorting them in the process. The sorted two-element pairs is merged into the four-element lists, and so on until we get the sorted list.</p>
        
        <br />
        <h2 class="h2">Working of Merge sort Algorithm</h2>
        <br />
        <p>Now, let's see the working of merge sort Algorithm.</p>
        <p>To understand the working of the merge sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array. It will be easier to understand the merge sort via an example.</p>
        <p>Let the elements of array are -</p>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/merge-sort.png" alt="Merge sort">
        <p>According to the merge sort, first divide the given array into two equal halves. Merge sort keeps dividing the list into equal parts until it cannot be further divided.</p>
        <p>As there are eight elements in the given array, so it is divided into two arrays of size 4.</p>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/merge-sort2.png" alt="Merge sort">
        <p>Now, again divide these two arrays into halves. As they are of size 4, so divide them into new arrays of size 2.</p>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/merge-sort3.png" alt="Merge sort">
        <p>Now, again divide these arrays to get the atomic value that cannot be further divided.</p>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/merge-sort4.png" alt="Merge sort">
        <p>Now, combine them in the same manner they were broken.</p>
        <p>In combining, first compare the element of each array and then combine them into another array in sorted order.</p>

        <p>So, first compare 12 and 31, both are in sorted positions. Then compare 25 and 8, and in the list of two values, put 8 first followed by 25. Then compare 32 and 17, sort them and put 17 first followed by 32. After that, compare 40 and 42, and place them sequentially.</p>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/merge-sort5.png" alt="Merge sort">
        <p>In the next iteration of combining, now compare the arrays with two data values and merge them into an array of found values in sorted order.</p>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/merge-sort6.png" alt="Merge sort">
        <p>Now, there is a final merging of the arrays. After the final merging of above arrays, the array will look like -</p>
